# James and John

The next step after working with just one agent is having two different agents. Here we have two characters -

1. James
2. Johns

And by providing a conflicting character system information to each of the agents, and allowing them to talk after giving them some shared history -
we are able to see an interesting interactions between them.

As we have two different agents, there is quite a bit of text to go through when listening via the Azure TTS - thus, for this example I have sped up the playback by 2 times.
