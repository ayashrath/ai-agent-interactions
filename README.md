# AI Interactions

I was inspired by [DougDoug's](https://www.youtube.com/@DougDoug) AI videos, and wanted to make something similar.
Thus, I am making this. Shall add more detail on the project as I move further.

## The current plan (subject to change)

Have $n$ AI agents that are in the setting of a discussion board with different personalities. The specifics are not
yet clear, but there are two things I want to integrate

- democracy
- provide access to do anything within a certain dir (full access, but can't go beyond it!)

Also to make sure the project is close to DougDoug's streams the following needs to be created

- a ui that shows the conversations
- an audio narrating the responses

## Timeline for Phase 1

I need to implement the above by the end of the week - so 7th December 2025.

## Future Plan (subject to change)

These are features that I will add much later, not within this time period (this interval of developing this).

- add openai api manager (as I have $5 tokens bought and have not used, that expire next year April!)
- add deepseek api manager
- add claude api manager
- add grok api manager
- add meta ai api manager
- make it programmatically efficient
